The fair use calculator is a tool for people whose intellectual property has been used by unauthorized personel and they want to know if that usage qualifies as fair use. Fair use is the doctrine that brief excerpts of copyright material may, under certain circumstances, be quoted verbatim for purposes such as criticism, news reporting, teaching, and research, without the need for permission from or payment to the copyright holder. This tool is trained on the responses of people who have IP and have experienced their work being used by others without their permission. Then professional lawyers have analysed those reponses and determined a fair use % score that determines how likely this usage is fair use. The tool is then verified on a testing dataset comprised of historical legal cases involving fair use. The prompts answered for the training dataset are filled in with the circumstantial information of those cases and then from the judges verdict, a fair use % is calculated. Due to the limited schedule for this project, the datasets are not large enough to create a very accurate model, but for the size of it, the accuracy is not bad.
